## tailwindcss-animate

The original `tailwindcss-animate` plugin are consist with 2 parts
- Animations 
- Animation property modifiers

Animation property modifiers are already supported by `@unocss/preset-wind` or `@unocss/preset-uno`. Since this preset is based on them, so that part is removed.

Animations part remains as is, please refer to [Animations](/animations/).
